# No Catfish

## Eliminating Online Dating Deception Through Identity Verification

## Project Overview

No Catfish is a revolutionary identity verification system designed to bring authenticity and trust to online dating. By leveraging Self App's secure passport scanning technology, we ensure that every user's profile reflects their genuine identity - including real age, gender, name, and appearance. Our mission is to create a safer, more honest online dating environment where connections begin with truth.

## The Problem

Online dating platforms are plagued by fake profiles, misleading information, and identity deception:
- 53% of dating app users report encountering significantly misleading profiles
- Age falsification affects over 40% of dating profiles
- Gender misrepresentation creates safety concerns and violated trust
- Photos that don't match reality lead to wasted time and disappointment

## Our Solution

No Catfish integrates Self App's secure passport scanning technology directly into the dating experience:

1. **Verified Identity**: Users scan their passport or government ID
2. **Age Authentication**: Birthdate verification prevents misrepresentation
3. **Gender Confirmation**: Legal gender documentation for transparency
4. **Photo Matching**: Biometric comparison between ID photo and profile pictures
5. **Privacy Protection**: Verification data is encrypted and secured

## Technical Implementation

- **Self App API Integration**: Secure document scanning with high-accuracy OCR
- **Biometric Comparison**: Advanced facial recognition to match ID photos with uploaded content
- **Blockchain Verification**: Tamper-proof record of verification without storing sensitive data
